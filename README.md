# Orange Machine Learning Workflow Template

This repository contains an **Orange Data Mining workflow** (`Project1.ows`) designed as a template to learn how to build, use, and understand machine learning pipelines.  
The workflow integrates **data preprocessing, sampling, visualization, classification, and evaluation** into a single Orange project.

---

## üìå Workflow Capabilities
The workflow demonstrates the following actions inside Orange:

1. **Data Import & Preprocessing**
   - CSV File Import  
   - Column selection  
   - Train/test data sampling  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Feature distributions (age, sex, cholesterol, etc.)  

3. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Decision Tree + Tree Viewer  
   - Random Forest  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Gradient Boosting  

4. **Model Validation & Testing**
   - Validation on sampled data  
   - Test & Score widget for performance evaluation  
   - ROC curve and accuracy metrics

## üìä Learning Objectives
This workflow was used to:
- Practice building full ML pipelines in Orange  
- Understand differences between classifiers (tree-based, linear, ensemble)  
- Learn to split, train, validate, and test data in a structured process  
- Gain experience interpreting results via visualizations and scoring
